# 👋 Hi, I'm Ishaq!

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm a **Mechatronics and Control Systems Researcher** with deep focus on UAVs, hybrid dynamical systems, nonlinear control, electric drives, and real-time robotics. I work across theory, simulation, hardware, and open-source tools, merging research with practical systems.

## 🧠 Research Interests

- Nonlinear & Optimal Control 
- UAV Dynamics, SLAM, Sensor Fusion  
- Electric Drives, Flexible-Joint Robots  
- Metaheuristic Optimization & System Identification  
- Real-Time Embedded Systems & Robotics  
- Switched Systems, LMIs, Lyapunov-based Stability
