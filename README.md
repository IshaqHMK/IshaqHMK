# 👋 Hi, I'm Ishaq!

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm a **Mechatronics and Control Systems Researcher** with a focus on UAVs, nonlinear control, hybrid systems, electric drives, and real time robotics. My work involves both theoretical analysis and practical validation through simulation and hardware implementation.

## 🧠 Research Interests

- Nonlinear and Optimal Control
- UAV Dynamics, SLAM, Sensor Fusion
- Switched Systems, LMIs, Lyapunov based Stability
- Metaheuristic Optimization and System Identification
- Electric Drives, Flexible Joint Robots
- Real Time Embedded Systems and Robotics


You can explore my publications on [Google Scholar ↗](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7IBpmcUAAAAJ&hl=en).
